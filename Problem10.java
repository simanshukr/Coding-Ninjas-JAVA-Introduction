//The variable i =0. First time the loop executes,it increases 
//the variable by 1 , print is and then again increases it by 1, 
//making it 2. Now, second time, since the condition is true, 
//the variable i would be incaresed to 1 , ie. i=3 and would be 
//printed and so on the loop will continue, 
//till i=9. So the output would be all the odd numbers<10, which is : 13579
